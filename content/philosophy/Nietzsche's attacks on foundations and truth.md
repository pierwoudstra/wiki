*Nietzsche on foundations*
Genealogies ([[Nietzsche]]) are the historical origins of our assumptions about things that are supposedly self-evident. Using genealogies Nietzsche attacks the **foundations** upon which we base our arguments about morality, politics and even science.

*Nietzsche on truth*
Using the biological argument that, for example, our eyes developed to the point that we can see what we can see, and can't see microscopically small things or telescopically far away things, Nietzsche argues that our brain only developed to the point that is necessary for our survival and not any further.
Furthermore Nietzsche argues that **truth** is a feature of language, and not of reality because in language we denote individual objects with categories like 'snake', even though no two snakes are the same. We ignore almost all of the details of the object.
