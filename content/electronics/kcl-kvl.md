# KCL & KVL

## Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
KCL states that the total amount of current at a single node is equal to zero.  

Current coming towards the node is seen as positive and current leaving the node is seen as negative. 
In the example above we get +1 and + 3 amperes, totalling to +4A. Because of KCL we can conclude that the current leaving the node ($i_a$) is 4A.
