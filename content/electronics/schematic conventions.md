# Schematic conventions

Power flows from the top to the bottom of a schematic and signal flows left to right. Feedback flows from right to left. Low voltages are lower on the page than high voltages. Never, for instance, make a voltage divider or RC low pass filter where the input is at the bottom and ground is at the top. It’s worth making a few clunky jogs in a wire to adhere to these principles.

• Snarls in your wires confuse the tracing process, so keep traces straight.
• Only turn routes at ninety degree angles.    
• If at all possible, group busses into a single route rather than running many wires in parallel
