# Start writing

[[writing]]

Structure:
1. First, describe a situation
2. Next, describe a problem or question that arises from that situation
3. Now describe how others have responded to that problem or question
4. Explain a need to approach it in a different way or expand upon what's been done
5. Say what you aim to do...

Advice:
1. Reduce the scale of the task
	Focus on one section at a time (or, for practise, write short, standalone pieces with a specific focus)
2. Separate exploration from presentation
	If the goal is to get ideas on the page for you to work with, you can do that without writing in a 		formal, linear structure
	Exploration: writing on paper, non-linearly, mind-maps, etc.
3. If you can’t write the introduction at the beginning, you haven’t done all the experiments yet or don’t have all the data
4. Don’t skip problems, keep working where you focus is. This way you don’t have to decide which part to work on, you just continue
5. Sometimes a subject needs to be talked about earlier in the paper, in this case it’s okay to move back
