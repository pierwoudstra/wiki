Tot aan tweede graad cybernetics zit je al aan de 3000 woorden waarschijnlijk.
Beperken tot synthese maakt het wel specifieker.


How is cybernetic music different from other types of electroacoustic music (musique concrète, etc.)
Kayn:
“Cybernetic music is involved in process planning, feedback loops, control processes. It’s the suspension between automatic (or dead) and anthropogenic (or alive) systems.”

toen norvert wiener tijdens de tweede wereldoorlog werkte aan anti vliegtuig systemen, bevond hij dat feedback lussen crcuiaal zijn in autonome systemen. na de tweede werle oorlog vatte hij zijn nieuwe theorieen samen in een boek die hij vernoemde naar zijn nieuwe wetenschcappelijke stroming, namelijk cybernetica.


aantekeningen

CHRISTOPHER HAWORTH
Music and Cybernetics in Historical Perspective
Cybernetics was distinct from traditional sciences in aspiring to create a universal interdiscipline that patched together the probabilistic worldview of information theory and the flattened abstractions of systems theory

As a science, cybernetics is historical, left behind in the 20th century. Yet as a musical knowledge practice, it is positively contemporary, put to work either directly in the service of music theory, history, analysis, and composition or indirectly through the mediation of auditory psychology, structuralist and poststructuralist theory, or the methods associated with digital musicology.

3. As [[Norbert Wiener]] stated, “Our view of society differs from the ideal of society which is held by many Fascists, Strong Men in Business, and Government. . . . Such people prefer an organisation in which all orders come from above, and none return.” Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1950), 15–16. 


NORBERT WIENER Cybernetics (1947)

The planets move under conditions more favourable to the isolation of a certain limited set of forces than those of any physical experiment we can set up in the laboratory. (On the why astronomical physics is so accurate vs meteorology which can often be wrong and doesn’t compute well with Newtonian physics)

Let us consider a signal tower on a railroad. The signalman controls a number of levers which turn the semaphore signals on or off and which regulate
the setting of the switches. However, it does not do for him to assume blindly that the signals and the switches have followed his orders. It may be that the switches have frozen fast, or that the weight of a load of snow has bent the signal arms, and that what he has supposed to be the actual state of the switches and the signals his effectors -does not correspond to the orders he has given. To avoid the dangers inherent in this contingency, every effector, switch or signal, is attached to a telltale back in the signal tower, which conveys to the signalman its actual states and performance. This is the mechanical equivalent of the repeating of orders in the navy, according to a code by which every subordinate, upon the reception of an order, must repeat it back to his superior, to show that he has heard and understood it. It is on such repeated orders that the signalman must act.


Cybernetics in Music


In order to create electronic life, you have to be free to abuse the circuit
(Louis Barron in Greenwald, 1986).


THOMAS W. PATTESON
The Time of Roland Kayn’s Cybernetic Music

Filosoof Max Bense was belangrijk voor Kayn’s ontwikkeling in cybernetics omdat hij cybernetics met esthetiek verbond.

He distinguished between two aspects of aesthetic work: the first is what he called 'analytical aesthetics', in which 'aesthetic information [is] described in abstract (mathematical) terms'. Bense called the second phase 'generative aesthetics', in deliberate (if imprecise) analogy to the 'generative grammar' developed contemporaneously by Noam Chomsky.

'the improbability of aesthetic states can be produced mechanically through a methodical combination of planning and chance. In this way the demand that aesthetic objects have to satisfy - namely, to be unpredictable - is precisely combined with their planned construction'. 

He presented the history of the medium in five distinct phases, beginning in the early twentieth century and culminating with his own contribution circa 1970: 

Electro-instrumental music Extension and multiplication of the natural instrumental sounds by means of electro-acoustic aggregates. Incorporation of new instrumental techniques of playing and articulation.
 Concrete music Studio processing of existing sounds and noises, also of instrumental and vocal origin. 

Electronic music Electro-acoustic sound synthesis, obtained from electronic oscillation elements. Discovery of new connections between material, time, structure, space.
 Computer music Automation, chance, program. Logical and mathematical operations.

Cybernetic music Process planning, feedback loops, control processes. Suspension of the opposition of automatic ('dead') and anthropoetic ('living') systems.

Eind jaren 60 waren de bovenste drie fases al historisch, en ondanks de sterke associatie tussen de computer en cybernetics vond Kayn dat computer muziek tegenover cybernetic muziek stond. Geprogrammeerde processen op de computer gaven een precieze manier van synthese en compositie, deze manier van werken was nog steeds gebaseerd op het uitvoeren van commando’s, zoals een orkest. Voor Kayn was dit determinisme het verschil tussen computer muziek en cybernetic muziek. Kayn’s beeld van computer muziek kan gezien worden als een overgeneralisatie aangezien componisten als Iannis Xenakis, Herbert Brün, en Pietro Grossi niet deterministische compositie op de computer aan het onderzoeken waren.

Voor Kayn is cybernetic muziek een generatief proces waarbij geluidsmateriaal in zichzelf gevoed(feedback) wordt om variaties te maken op wat daarvoor kwam.
Met alleen maar één negatieve feedback lus oscilleert het systeem, opzoek naar equilibrium (zoals een thermostaat). Naarmate er meer informatie wordt toegevoegd aan het systeem wordt het gedrag van het systeem minder voorspelbaar, dit geeft de non-lineariteit die inherent is aan cybernetic muziek.

De sound van Kayn’s cybernetic composities wordt gekenmerkt door de analoge apparatuur van de Instituut van Sonologie in Utrecht. Dit was een soort proto modulair synth systeem met functie generatoren die een soort basic vorm zijn van een sequencer. Verder waren er oscillatoren, filters, envelope generatoren en logica circuits. Dit was rond 1970.

Kayn maakte sonische systemen die gekenmerkt waren doordat ze niet volledig deterministisch(voorbedacht?) waren maar ook niet volledig willekeurig, maar in een richting ‘gestuurd’ waren om in de etymologische geest van cybernetics te blijven.
Uit dit artikel blijkt dat controle in die tijd een centraal vraagstuk was in experimentele muziek. Aan de ene kant was het complete indeterminisme van John Cage en free jazz en aan de andere kant kon men met behulp van nieuwe digitale technologie preciezer dan ooit een compositie inprogrammeren.

Kayn asserts that 'the electronic system develops a sort of capacity to think for itself, a capacity which in a sense can be described as artificial intelligence [... ] Existential Being, as it were, takes the place of a logically functioning consciousness’

'the electric current has no memory, is governed only by the present, and is thus in great measure authorised to unleash improbable phenomena’
Kayn, 'Soziologische-, technologische- und ästhetische Aspekte. 


it was Jaap Vink who actually built the system, as Sascha Frere-Jones wrote in 4Columns. Given the intimacy that cybernetic musicians necessarily have with their tools, his fingerprints are deeply embedded in Kayn’s electronic works.
Vink referred to himself as a technician, not a composer, and it’s possible that the concealment of his status was his preference.

FRANS VAN ROSSUM

Basically, Kayn would design networks of electronic equipment and then develop a system of signals and commands that it could obey and execute. 
Kayn insisted that his "cybernetic" music should regulate itself, thereby relinquishing the narrative elements and the psycho-emotional details usually associated with the ideas of "authorship" and "work of art." This meant that even he could not predict the eventual composition, which were sound processes without an epicentre, where every sound is equally important. For Kayn, "Music is sound, which is sufficient in itself." Roland Kayn felt that present day composers should avail themselves of the electronic techniques at their disposal and that electronic music is more than just the result of rapidly expanding technology.	

In principe zou Kayn netwerken van elektronische apparatuur ontwerpen en vervolgens een systeem van signalen en commando's ontwikkelen die het zou kunnen gehoorzamen en uitvoeren. 
Kayn stond erop dat zijn “cybernetische” muziek zichzelf zou reguleren, daarmee afstand doend van de verhalende elementen en de psycho-emotionele details die gewoonlijk geassocieerd worden met de ideeën van “auteurschap” en “kunstwerk”. Dit betekende dat zelfs hij de uiteindelijke compositie niet kon voorspellen, die bestond uit klankprocessen zonder epicentrum, waarbij elk geluid even belangrijk is. Voor Kayn is “muziek geluid, dat op zichzelf voldoende is”. Roland Kayn vond dat hedendaagse componisten gebruik moesten maken van de elektronische technieken die ze tot hun beschikking hadden en dat elektronische muziek meer is dan alleen het resultaat van snel groeiende technologie.


NEIL O CONNOR
Éliane Radigue & The ARP 2500 Modular Synthesiser 

Stafford Beer, In The Brain of the Firm, provided a valuable insight into the relationship of music and to the synthesizer, in that, he quotes; ‘instead of trying to specify it (a system) in full detail, you specify it only somewhat. You then ride on the dynamics of the system in the direction you want it to go’ (Beer 1972, 68-69)


TED GREENWALD
The Self-Destructing Modules Behind Revolutionary 1956 Soundtrack of Forbidden Planet
Originally printed in Keyboard Magazine February 1986: 54-65.

Louis Barron’s circuits are not like synthesizer patches. They aren’t made up of general-purpose modules, wired together in various configurations to produce different sounds. Each one is an entity unto itself. Louis sees his circuits not as mere machines, designed to produce some predictable sonic pattern on command. Rather, the essential aspect of their design is that they are unpredictable. Once activated, the circuit comes to life, wailing, screeching, or singing until some internal component becomes overloaded and fails. At this point the creature dies, emitting its final howls and whispers in a swan song of power failure.

The next step in the Barrons’ compositional process is to prod the circuit to life by “applying a stimulant. It could be a voltage coming in from the outside, or it could be letting more current pass internally by changing a resistance, or by adjusting some kind of feedback.” The method of control is always manual, a variable resistor or capacitor built right into the circuit. Louis doesn’t think in terms of filtering, amplifying, oscillating, or any of the component sound-shaping processes that synthesists are familiar with. “The circuit itself would have a number of those things going on internally to get the total result. If it sounded good to us, we’d try to capture it on tape. From then on we’d have the tape as working material.”

“Then I would go through all the tapes and find things I thought had potential for further processing, and were relevant to the film” Bebe says, explaining the methods used for Forbidden Planet. “Then together we would start processing, and that was the really fun part. The sounds didn’t come out of the circuits sounding the way they did in the end. We did lots of things to those sounds, although we were severely limited by the technology of the ’50s. But we did the usual kinds of things that people did in those days, like tape-speed changes and all. The processing would go on for weeks. One problem was that the tape and the equipment was so terribly poor in those days; we developed lots of noise. There were some things that were slowed down a hundred times, and by then you’ve developed a severe amount of noise.”

“To me,” Louis explains, “these circuits are as if a living thing were crying out, expressing itself. There’s an organic type of behavior going on.”

“The circuits’ life cycles have always been kind of a trademark of our stuff,” Bebe agrees. “It sounds like so much mumbo-jumbo, but it’s really true.” The Barrons’ ability to breathe virtual life into a concoction of tubes, capacitors, and resistors at one time attracted serious interest on the part of the scientific community. “It was really weird,” remembers Bebe. “A group of four or five scientists came up from the Salk Institute [in La Jolla, California] to visit us. They were studying the secret of life, or the origins of life, and they read something that Louis had written. They were so intrigued by this, they spent a whole day talking to us about the life cycles of our circuits,”

“Luening and Ussachevsky were getting started with that at the same time we were. I felt that that was the wrong direction, because laboratory instruments are made to be very precise and very definite, and people aren’t. Art isn’t. In working with the circuits, you think they’ll do one thing, and usually they do something even more interesting that you hadn’t expected. It’ll be an abstract thing, which can be linked to a different emotional experience, or a scene in a movie, or whatever. So I tried to make a circuit—not unpredictable, but with a built-in uncertainty.”

“With synthesizers, you tell the machine what you want and then hope that it can do it. With me, I don’t know what I want—I’ve given up wanting. I might have an expectation, but I’m process-oriented. I care about what goes on, and I accept what comes out. If it sounds good, I accept it gratefully.”

“The question is, should I be concerned primarily with what’s going to come out, or with what’s going on inside of me? This need to have control all down the line—the composer has to control the performer, the performer has to control the audience — this is an influence that we’re going to have to shed.”

The technology that made the Barrons’ creations possible, on the other hand, was the vacuum tube. Unlike the major developments of later years—transistors, integrated circuits, digital processing—tubes can absorb the stress of being fed more electricity than they are capable of processing. As Louis puts it, “Tubes are forgiving. The grid of a power tube may be expected to take one or two volts,’ let’s say,” he explains. “If you accidentally touch it with 300 volts, it’ll heat up, it’ll get red in the face. Take the voltage away and it’ll cool down, ready to do its normal thing. A transistor would blow in a fraction of a millisecond. And even if they don’t cost much, they’re a damn nuisance to keep changing.” In order to create electronic life, says Louis, “you have to be free to abuse the circuit.
“That’s part of it, but there’s something else,” he continues. “Transistors have odd powers, whereas tubes have even powers. That’s a significant factor. Even harmonics are rather pleasant, and odd harmonics are not.”

The First Electronic Filmscore - Forbidden Planet: A CONVERSATION WITH BEBE BARRON

“But there it all was in Cybernetics. For example, probability: Gibbs had just inserted probability Into the whole physics realm. Probability not only made random sounds O.K. in our minds, it also increased entropy- which was what we were trying for. Then, in Cybernetics there was also information theory: the more probable something is, the less information it transmits. Clichés, of course, are the least illuminating of all.”

“Yes, and then there were the fine points of entropy: all closed systems tend to deteriorate and lose their distinctiveness. Our circuits really did just that”


JENNIFER IVERSON
Unstable Modernism in the Barron Studio

The Barrons’ collaboration extends into a network, however, when we consider the constraints of both the technological and the funding systems in which they worked. Parroting Wiener’s Cybernetics—and forecasting the ideological coordinates of actor-network theory—the Barrons conceptualised their own agency in a dance with the agency of the circuits:
The instructions inform [the circuits] how they should react and interact to the sensations they receive from other circuits, and how they should react to their own behaviour, which they sample through feedback loops. This means that these circuits have an awareness of what other circuits are doing, what they themselves are doing, and what is expected of them by the designer—in this case the composer. (Quoted in Nin, The Diary of Anaïs Nin, vol. V, 99, emphasis in original)
Exercising a thoroughly cybernetic imagination, the Barrons took seriously the circuits’ behaviours, which were only somewhat transparent and modifiable, since the circuits’ behaviours were determined partly by the circulating feedback. The Barrons’ human ability to intervene had to be channeled through the system, through the feedback loops, through the inputs and currents, all of which had their own energies. The limited-life circuits became the film’s characters. As Louis said, “these circuits are as if a living thing were crying out, expressing itself. There’s an organic type of behaviour going on.”

Louis Barron: Pioneer of tube audio effect



He kept a record of his circuits on thousands of small note cards like the one pictured on the left—what an index system. The circuit is a modified diode ring modulator, followed by a difference amplifier and diode “clamp” circuit. Louis added a few “tweaks” that are not straight out of the textbook—see the additional diodes in the ring circuit? There’s little doubt these mods were added in an attempt to generate some specific sound effect—a dream or idea in his subconscious mind—but without being able to talk to him in person, or see written notes, it’s impossible to know for sure what sound he was in search of.


NATHAN HO
Cybernetic Synthesis and Roland Kayn

These don’t have precise mathematical meanings, and they’re about attitude and philosophy over signal processing. Even then, they’re restrictive: the vast majority of electronic music production workflows, including my typical process, are clearly not cybernetic. Top-down sequencing of musical events, whether manually entered or generated by algorithms, is entirely disallowed in this paradigm. Most of us employ a separation of concerns between sequencing and synthesizer; in cybernetic synthesis, my experience is that these systems necessarily have to be blurred, with the synthesis and sequencing “melting” into each other. We saw in the above example that we didn’t make explicit note events to speak of, but rather they emerged from the system.

It’s important to note here that the mere presence of feedback isn’t sufficient for a system to be cybernetic. Cybernetic synthesis is more radical than that: it demands that everything ultimately affects everything else in feedback. It could be one big loop, it could be multiple interacting loops, but there cannot be any signal flow that’s completely unidirectional. In graph theory terms, we could say that the directed graph of signal flow should be strongly connected, meaning there is a directed path from every node to every other node.
