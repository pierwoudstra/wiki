A physical exploration of a digital technique.

physical² model is an electroacoustic installation and instrument inspired by physical modelling synthesis. 
It consists of a transducer and a movable contact microphone mounted on a metal sheet. The sound captured by the contact microphone is processed using Karplus-Strong synthesis and fed back to the transducer, effectively making the vibrational modes of the metal plate audible. 
The result is a complex, generative soundscape composed of the overtones of the plate's natural frequencies. 
physical² model also has an electrical monochord controller to determine the specific pitch of the Karplus-Strong synthesis, this extra control makes it a two player instrument which also works as an installation (0-1 players).
