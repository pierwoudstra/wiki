# Linguistics

Linguistics is the study of languages. The approach linguists use is guided by two principles:
1. Spoken language comes first.
2. Linguistics is descriptive, not prescriptive.

The reason linguistics is based on spoken language is twofold. 
Firstly all *natural language*s (existing and extinct) have had native speakers, while only a minority of them have ever had a written form.
Secondly, in *natural languages*, writing derives from speech, but is rarely a faithful or consistent representation of it.

That linguistics should be descriptive seems a logical result of it being a science.
You wouldn't expect an astrophysicist to write papers on "beautiful" versus "ugly" planets or a biologist to rate plants based on "purity" or societal standards!
