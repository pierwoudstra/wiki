# Morphology

Morphology is the study of word structure. It lies between phonetics (sounds) and grammar (structure of words). 

## Derivational morphology

Derivational morphology is concerned with the creation of new words.
It is one of two ways new words enter a language; either through other languages (borrowing words), or creation from existing resources (derivation).

**Morphemes** are the smallest morphological unit of a language (e. g. *in, come, -ing* forming *incoming*).

**Bound** morphemes cannot stand alone and are thus always part of a word.
While **free** morphemes are standalone words like "dog", or "come."

Words can be derived using bound morphemes (**affixation**) or free ones (**compounding**).
Morphemes most commonly used in affixation are **prefixes** and **suffixes**.

## Inflectional morphology

Inflectional morphology involves the marking of gender, number and/ or tense through morphology (- grammatical categories).

The amount of inflectional morphology varies per language. Where for example in Latin a word that is being used as an indirect object (*dative*) will look completely different from an object or subject, while in English these two are the same.

### Classifying languages

- Isolating languages (e. g. Chinese) have no bound morphemes.
- Agglutinating languages (e. g. Turkish) have words built from morphemes with a single meaning or grammatical function.
- Inflecting languages (e. g. Russian) use bound morphemes to mark several grammatical categories.
- Polysynthetic languages (e. g. Inuit) build 'sentence-words' out of bound morphemes rather then constructing sentences from free ones, as for example English.

### Number and gender values

Inflectional morphology mark grammatical categories (e. g. tense, number or gender). The values of these categories vary according to language.
While English only has two *number* values; singular and plural, many languages have more complex systems with multiple values.
*Gender* also varies with language. French for example has two values for gender, while German has three and Dyirbal has four.
