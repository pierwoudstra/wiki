## Predicators and arguments

Sentences consist of a predicate and one or more arguments. The predicate expresses a property of an argument or a relationship between arguments.
A predicate has a number of arguments with which it is associated. A verb like *exist* realises a one-place predicate ('John exists') while the transitive verb *eat* realises a two-place predicate ('John eats an apple').
