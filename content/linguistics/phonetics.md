# Phonetics

As a result of spoken language being important in linguistics, it is necessary to have a objective way to analyse spoken language. This is where phonetics and the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) come in.

I will skip phonetics for now because I am not interested in learning a very extensive writing system.
