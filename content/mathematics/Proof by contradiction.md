Proof by contradiction

Thm: P.
Pf. For the sake of contradiction, assume P is false. Then ... Then R is both true and false. (So our assumption is wrong, so P is true. )

Thm: $\sqrt 2 \notin Q$.
Pf. For the sake of contradiction, assume $\sqrt 2 \in Q$. 
So $\sqrt 2 = a/b$, where $a,b \in Z, b \neq 0$.
in lowest terms, so $a$ and $b$ have no common divisors.

$a = \sqrt 2 \times b$
$a^2 = 2b^2$
$a^2$ is even. 
Therefore $a$ is even.
So $a = 2c$ for some integer $c$.

$(2c)^2 = 2b^2$
$4c^2 = 2b^2$
$2c^2 = b^2$
$b^2$ is even.
Therefore $b$ is even.

$a$ and $b$ are both even, so they have a common factor of $2$.
This is a contradiction with the definition of a common divisor in lowest terms.
